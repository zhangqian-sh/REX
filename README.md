# REX
Run Experiment with JAX. REX contains

1. Functional style high-level APIs for training/evaluating deep learning model in JAX
2. Some utilities functions for loading configs and h5 data.

Just define your own `batch_iter` and `save_results` function to transforma and save your data. Leave the rest tedious work to REX!
